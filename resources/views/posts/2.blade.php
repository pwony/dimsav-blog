        Some time ago I was having a chat with a high ranked executive of a popular tv channel for
        kids. He was a nice person.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl px-5 my-12">
        He was bragging about how he managed to save the company from bankruptcy, even though they
        had to show illegally "sometimes" (I'm sure he meant most of the times) advertisement
        targeted to kids on their channel, exceeding the ad duration per how allowed by the law.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl px-5 my-12">
        One day, the tv at home was on this channel, and my kids were watching these advertisements
        of toys. They were so offensive I felt discussed. The same day, my kid asked me (of course)
        to buy him many of the toys he watched on the ads the same day.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl px-5 my-12">
        Don't get me wrong. I love and I feel obliged buying toys to my children. My problem with
        ads is that they produce fake needs, without limit.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl px-5 my-12">
        I felt obliged as a parent to prevent my kids being brainwashed by those offensive ads since
        then. Of course kids want to watch cartoons. So what are the alternatives?
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl px-5 my-12">
        The easiest and simplest solution for us is Netflix.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl px-5 my-12">
        We prefer paying a monthly subscription than having our kids watch free tv but being
        brainwashed from ads. Sometimes I wonder, am I overprotective?
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl px-5 my-12">
        Am I doing more harm by isolating a kid from what nowadays is considered the norm? I believe
        and I hope I'm not the only one taking the same decision.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl px-5 my-12">
        And if the number of parents choosing non "free" but ad-less tv increases over time,
        probably this is a good thing. Because studios that produce "good" content are promoted
        versus those who promote advertisement time for their customers.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl px-5 my-12">
        I'm not a fan of Netflix, but I'm afraid that's the best alternative we have right now, and
        maybe this means that the market of subscription based tv will increase in the future. And I
        believe this is a good thing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl px-5 my-12">
        Time will show.
